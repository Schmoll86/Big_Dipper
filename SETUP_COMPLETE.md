## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

**Mode:** LIVE TRADING (ALPACA_PAPER=false)
**Log Level:** DEBUG (shows detailed opportunity scanning)
**Symbols:** 44 stocks across tech, utilities, defense, healthcare, materials
**Scan Interval:** 60 seconds
**Emergency Brake:** Active at 15.73% margin

## üîÑ Key Features (v2.16)

**Enhanced from Little Dipper:**
1. **Emergency Brake Visibility** - Shows missed opportunities during margin halt
2. **Capital Exhaustion Logging** - Logs skipped trades when funds depleted
3. **Utility Functions** - Refactored for cleaner code and maintainability
4. **Same Risk Filters** - All Little Dipper v2.15 protections intact

**Inherited from Little Dipper:**
- 5 smart risk filters (crash, volume, momentum, volatility, dynamic cooldown)
- Stock-specific thresholds (3-8% based on volatility)
- 5% absolute minimum dip (prevents threshold gaming)
- Dual margin protection (15% emergency brake, 20% hard limit)
- Extended hours trading (4 AM - 8 PM ET)
- Options/manual trading coexistence

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Reduce margin debt by ~$255** to drop below 15% threshold
2. **Start Big Dipper** using one of the methods above
3. **Monitor logs** to see opportunities being scanned
4. **Review trades** as they execute (when margin allows)

## üõü Troubleshooting

**If Big Dipper won't start:**
```bash
cd /Users/ryanschmoll/Desktop/Big_Dipper
source venv/bin/activate
python test_dip_logic.py  # Should show all tests passing
```

**If API errors occur:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Alpaca API status: https://status.alpaca.markets/
- Check .env credentials are correct

**To switch to paper trading:**
```bash
# Edit .env file
ALPACA_PAPER=true  # Change false to true
```
